  	<p>KRIBHCO recognizes its ethical responsibility to protect environment and is committed to regulate all its activities using best available technology to mitigate adverse environmental impact, if any that may arise out of its operations. KRIBHCO is a “Zero effluent discharge organization”, effluent generated is treated and used in farms.</p>
		<p>Our actions aim at continually improving the efficiency of our operations and to remain always compliant with the conditions of our environmental consents and other requirements issued by statutory bodies. At KRIBHCO the in house environment norms are even more stringent as compared to statutory norms of Government. Society has implemented Integrated Management System certified as per international standards ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 to ensure continual improvement of the organization on all fronts of Quality, Environment and Occupational Health & Safety</p>

KRIBHCO is deeply committed to environmental protection, thus fulfilling compliance obligations and achieving environmental objectives. Society has implemented ISO 45001, Environmental Management System to ensure continual and systemic improvement. Internal & External Audits are conducted periodically for checking efficacy of the system. </p>

<p>
Society is putting all out efforts to protect and conserve the natural resources so that healthy environment is created to safeguard the present and future generation. The society has taken various steps to achieve its goal and some of the measures taken are as follows:</p>
<p>
<i class="icofont-circled-right" style="font-size:18px;"></i> KRIBHCO is fully conscious about its responsibility to the environment. Therefore, care of environment has always been paramount importance to KRIBHCO. The philosophy of <strong>“Reduce, Re-use & Re-cycle”</strong> has been adopted for usage of the resources within and outside our organization wherever our employees are associated:
<li> Tertiary treated sewage water is being reused as cooling water make up. Part of Cooling Tower blow down water is being Reused for horticulture/ farming. Society has reduced the quantity of cooling tower make up by increasing the cycle of concentration. </li>
<li> Society is recycling the rinsing water of Anion & Cation exchangers & boiler blow down water of power plant to D.M. plant intake. Recycling of process waste condensate of ammonia plants & urea plants after treatment in deep hydrolyser used as boiler feed water make up</li>
<li> Approximately 2000 m3/day of cooling tower blow down water is sent to M/s. Adani Hazira Port Pvt. Ltd., Surat for their industrial use and spraying on coal. Hence, our liquid effluent is being used by them as a resource thus conserving the natural resources.</li>
<li>By persistent efforts KRIBHCO has been able to reduce its water consumption from 10.14 MGD (1986) to 7.60 MGD (2019-20) during the 34 years of venture & at the same time it has increased its production capacity from 4400 to 6650 MT/day of Urea.</li><br>
<p>Society has achieved zero liquid effluent discharge from the final outlet of balancing pond since the year 2003. </p>
<p>
As a surveillance measure IP camera with PAN, TILT, Zoom, 5x focal length with night vision capability and flow meters have been installed at the final discharge point
</p>
</p>

<p>
<i class="icofont-circled-right" style="font-size:18px;"></i> A number of projects have been commissioned for improving the energy efficiency and towards pollution abatement. Continuous efforts are being made to check the emission of pollutants in the air:

<li>	Wet de-dusting system at Prilling tower top has been installed and emission of the Urea dust and Ammonia in the atmosphere is well below the specified limits.</li>
<li>	During the revamp of Urea plants, a new scrubber (C-60) was installed.  Low Pressure section off gases and waste water section off gases carrying ammonia are recycled to C-60 for recovery of ammonia. Venting of ammonia bearing gases from LP section and waste water section of Urea plant has become almost nil. Moreover, during HP loop draining, system hold up is almost totally recovered with the implementation of above scheme.  </li>
<li>	Vibro-priller has been installed in prilling towers of Urea Phase I & II. This has resulted in not only the improvement of Urea product quality but also reduction in urea dust emission from prilling tower top.</li>
<li>	Steam Stripper in Urea Plant has been installed in both Phases to recover ammonia from liquid effluent of the Complex.</li>
<li>	Society had implemented a scheme to store the excess effluent during Shut-Down or Upset Condition in Bio-Hydrolyser (~1100 m3).</li>
<li>	Sprinkler System has been installed on the periphery of Guard Pond to improve the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen. </li>
<li>	New wet scrubbing system has been installed at urea product fall point from MT-3 to BC-1 to recover the micro dust from the product and the urea solution is recycled to urea plant</li>
</p>
<p>
<i class="icofont-circled-right" style="font-size:18px;"></i> To monitor the quality of liquid effluent and emission of pollutants in air, online continuous liquid effluent monitoring system and continuous emission monitoring systems have been installed. All the stacks and liquid effluent quality data are displayed continuously at factory main gate and also have been linked to CPCB/GPCB server.
</p>

<p>
<i class="icofont-circled-right" style="font-size:18px;"></i> A continuous online ambient air monitoring station has been installed in the plant premises for continuous monitoring of ambient air quality and the data are displayed continuously at factory main gate. Apart from this, ambient air quality is also being monitored fortnightly within a radius of 10 km from our complex for periodic monitoring of air quality in the surrounding area. Emission of pollutants to air from the various stacks is well below the limits specified by regulatory bodies.
</p>

<p>
<i class="icofont-circled-right" style="font-size:18px;"></i> To create awareness among contract workers, an audio-video module on Environment Protection has been developed which is shown to all the contract workers and thereafter, they are allowed to work in the plant premises.
</p>

<p>
<i class="icofont-circled-right" style="font-size:18px;"></i> Society has undertaken a forestation program and trees of different species are planted every year in order to improve the ambient air quality. Lush green lawns are developed in an area of 100 acres and a demonstration farm has been developed in an area of 41 acres.</p>

<p>
<i class="icofont-circled-right" style="font-size:18px;"></i> In order to improve product quality, with minimal dust generations from the reclaimed product, new vibrating screens are under implementation.</p>
<br>
<p>
To ensure clean and green environment, Society has created a green belt by planting trees of different species based on Air Pollution Tolerance Index thus helping to improve the ambient air quality within the complex. </p></div>
