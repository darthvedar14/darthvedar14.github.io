Late Smt. Indira Gandhi, former Prime Minister of India laid the Foundation Stone on February 5, 1982. Hazira Fertiliser Complex consists of 2 x 1350 MTPD Ammonia Plants and 4 x 1100 MTPD Urea Plants each with annual installed capacity of 8.91 Lakh MT Ammonia and 14.52 Lakh MT of Urea. In an endeavor to make constant improvements, KRIBHCO implemented various schemes to enhance its capacity and improve the energy consumption. Capacities of Ammonia & Urea plants were reassessed to 2x1520 MTPD Ammonia and 4x1310 MTPD Urea with annual installed capacity of 10.03 Lakh MT Ammonia and 17.29 Lakh MT of Urea. The Hazira Fertilizer Complex was subsequently revamped in 2013 to increase its capacity by 4.65 LMTPA Urea as well as to infuse new life. After the revamp, the rated capacity has been enhanced to 2x3325 MTPD Urea (21.95 LMTPA) and 2x1890 MTPD Ammonia (12.47 LMTPA). With this, the Hazira Fertilizer Complex has become the largest Single Location Urea Plant in India. Production at Hazira UreaUrea is a white crystalline substance with the chemical formula NH2-CO-NH2; it is highly water soluble and contains 46% nitrogen. It is used extensively as chemical fertilizer as well as for industrial uses. Urea is produced in Prilled as well as in Granular forms. KRIBHCO’s Hazira Complex produces Prilled urea using the technology supplied by M\/s Snamprogetti (now Saipem) of Italy.
